## Inspiration
We all took Programming in C (CS240) and structs were one of the main topics taught. We learned about their usefulness in programming which included setting pointers to them, pointers inside of them, and their **memory layout** in a physical computer. Our team realized while learning the memory layout there were no online visual tools that showed the individual variables and their positions in the memory. Another concept that was hard to learn was the use of padding and when the compiler uses it. Because of this, we all committed this weekend to the challenge and worked as a team.
## What it does
This website creates a C data type struct visualizer that accurately shows the memory map layout of a struct. Bananas shows the padding.
## How we built it
We built it using React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
## Challenges we ran into
Main challenges where:
1. Creating an algorithm that accurately outputs a 2D array of the memory layout.
2. Working with new languages and trying to understand their functionality.
3. Trying to make an algorithm that efficiently handles all edge cases while containing proficient code.
4. Working and communicating as a team in a stressed environment.
5. Everything
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to create a website that will help others in a fun and easy. We are also proud that we were able to complete this in a day which challenged our programming skills in a way we did not think this project could.
## What we learned
We learned a lot more about structs and React, as well as our ability to stick together as a team and accomplish tasks efficiently
## What's next for PaddingSplit
We will add some more variable types, such as strings, whose length can be set from user input. We will also add compatibility for 32-bit computers. Finally, we can always make it look more pretty and challenge our frontend skills :)
